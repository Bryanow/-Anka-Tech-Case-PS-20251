Okay, Bryan! Here is the unified and updated README.md content, translated into English, ready for your project's root directory.

AnkaTechCase - Client and Financial Asset Management
This project was developed as part of the Anka Tech hiring process and aims to manage clients and their financial asset allocations. The application consists of a backend API and a frontend interface, both developed in TypeScript and containerized via Docker.

Prerequisites
To set up and run this project, you will need the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v18+ recommended)
npm (or yarn/pnpm/bun, if preferred)
Docker (for managing the MySQL database and backend service)
Project Setup and Initialization
Follow these step-by-step instructions to get the project up and running. All commands should be executed in your Powershell (or similar) terminal from the project root folder AnkaTechCase/ (where this README.md file is located), unless otherwise specified.

1. Initial Preparation
Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:
Bash

cd backend
npm install
Navigate back to the project root folder:
Bash

cd ..
Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:
Bash

cd frontend
npm install
Navigate back to the project root folder:
Bash

cd ..
2. Backend and Database Setup & Initialization (Docker Compose)
The project uses a MySQL database and the backend service, both easily managed via Docker Compose.

Navigate to the backend directory:

Bash

cd backend
Ensure you are in the directory containing docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile for the backend.

Clean up the Docker environment and start the services:
It's crucial to start with a clean database to ensure migrations and seeding work correctly.

Bash

docker-compose down -v # Removes containers and volumes (DB data)
docker-compose up --build -d # Builds/rebuilds the backend image and starts services in the background
This command will:

Build the backend Docker image using its Dockerfile.
Start the MySQL container, internally accessible by the backend service at db:3306.
Start the backend service, exposing port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on your host machine (localhost:3000).
Database URL Configuration:
For the backend service running inside Docker Compose, the DATABASE_URL environment variable is defined in docker-compose.yml as mysql://root:root@db:3306/ankadb, using the internal service name db.

If you are running the backend application locally (outside Docker Compose, which is not the main focus of this README, but for your information), your .env file in the backend directory should contain:

DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3307/ankadb"
(This assumes your db service in Docker Compose maps its internal port 3306 to 3307 on your host, allowing local connections).

3. Applying Prisma Migrations
With Docker services running and the database clean, apply the migrations to create the tables in your database:

Bash

docker-compose exec backend npx prisma migrate dev --name init_database_schema --schema src/prisma/schema.prisma
Attention: If Prisma asks "Do you want to reset your database?", type y (yes) and press Enter. This might happen because you removed the volumes in the previous step.
You should see messages indicating that migrations were applied and the Prisma Client was generated.
4. Initial Database Population (Seed)
To populate the database with initial client and asset data (including allocations), run the seed script:

Bash

docker-compose exec backend node dist/prisma/seed.js
You should see log messages like Start seeding ..., Upserted asset..., Upserted client..., and Upserted client asset..., indicating that the data has been successfully inserted.

**Note:** The `seed` script in the backend's `package.json` has been adjusted to `node dist/prisma/seed.js` to ensure correct execution within the container.
5. Frontend Initialization
Now that the backend and database are running and populated, you can start the frontend.

Navigate back to the frontend directory:
Bash

cd ../frontend
Start the Frontend Development Server:
Bash

npm run dev
The frontend will be accessible in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.
6. Accessing the Application
Access the frontend in your browser: http://localhost:3000
To view the client list and their allocations, navigate to: http://localhost:3000/clients
Important: Ensure that the API endpoint in your frontend (frontend/src/app/clients/page.tsx or related service files) correctly points to the backend (http://localhost:3000 or similar, depending on your configuration).
Backend API Endpoints
The backend exposes the following endpoints:

POST /clients - Create a new client
GET /clients - List all clients
PUT /clients/:id - Update an existing client
(Assuming there are also CRUD endpoints for Assets and ClientAssets if needed)

Entity Structure
Refer to the model in backend/prisma/schema.prisma to understand the structure of the entities (Client, Asset, ClientAsset).

Important Notes
The .env file SHOULD NOT BE VERSIONED (it's already in .gitignore).
The project uses Zod for data validation in both the backend and frontend.
The Prisma Client is initialized in backend/src/utils/prisma.ts.
The frontend uses ShadCN for UI components, React Query for data fetching, and React Hook Form with Zod for form handling.
This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load the Geist font.
Useful Scripts
All scripts below should be executed from the directory where the corresponding package.json is located (i.e., backend/ for backend scripts and frontend/ for frontend scripts).

Stop all Docker services (from backend/):
Bash

docker-compose down
Start all Docker services (from backend/):
Bash

docker-compose up -d
Run the database seed (from backend/):
Bash

npm run seed # (After initial setup and build)
Start Backend in Development Mode (from backend/ - without Docker Compose for backend):
Bash

npm run dev # (If you are not using docker-compose for the backend)
Start Frontend in Development Mode (from frontend/):
Bash

npm run dev
